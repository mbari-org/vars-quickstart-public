Delving deeper into mining this temporally and spatially rich dataset, standardized data products are created to provide a variety of data snapshots (e.g. raw or normalized depth distribution histograms for any observed taxa) allowing for efficient review and analysis. These new tools are delivering quantitative and qualitative information required for biodiversity assessment studies within MBARI’s research locations and could provide context for and contribute to modeling of studies farther afield.
